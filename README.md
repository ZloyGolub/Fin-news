Fin News - Training Layout for Web Development Practice 2020 year

Welcome to Fin News, a simple and stylish website created as a practice project during my early web development journey. This layout was designed to hone my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills while mimicking the look and feel of a professional financial news portal.

Although this site doesn't provide actual news or updates, it showcases:

Clean and responsive design
Basic structure of a news website, including headlines, sections, and navigation
Custom styling and layout techniques
